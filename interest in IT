My interest in IT has come from 2 incidents that came from 2 friends who were being misslead. 
<!---The 1st incident happened when a friend who i will call N was chatting to a guy online in the USA.She was becoming in love with the guy 
<!---And was even going to leave Australia to be with this guy.So i just did a google search on his name at 1st and found out a lot on this guy.
<!---Like he told her he owned a Harley Davidson bike shop,which was false,he told her he owned a big house, which i found out was his mothers
<!---and he rented the basement of her house and also had an extentsive criminal histroy.The 2nd incident occoured when a friend of mine was dating a teacher
<!---and i found out they were on charges of indecent dealings with 2 underaged students from 2 different schools
